# Makegist Reddit Bot

Makegist Reddit Bot [/u/makegist]() is a Reddit Bot which allows users to create Github gists from a Reddit Comment. This allows you to easily download the code as a gist file directly from your terminal.

This is especially useful in subreddits such as [/r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) which have a lot of code samples which you might want to test.

To summon the bot, reply to a comment which has code in it with : _**+/u/makegist [filename.ext]**_ where _filename_ is the name you want to give to the gist file and _ext_ the extension.
